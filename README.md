# MqttSteps
UserDefined Steps form MQTT actions (Publish, Subscribe)

This project demonstrates how Simio can communicate using the MQTT protocol.

It uses Simio Steps to publish to Topics, and Simio Elements to Subscribe to MQTT Topics and Fire Simio Events.

The examples use the MQTT Mosquitto Server/Broker and utilize the MQTTNet library.

See the Documenation for more information.
